How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves understanding their requirements and translating them into code. User stories help by breaking down these needs into smaller, actionable tasks. They provide a clear description of what the user wants, the value it brings, and the acceptance criteria. This guides the development process and ensures that the end product aligns with user expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development by first understanding the problem and breaking it into smaller components. Then, I plan the solution, write code incrementally, and continuously test and refine it. In my future development work, I hope to incorporate agile processes like Scrum. I want to collaborate closely with the team, have regular iterations for feedback, and deliver functional software early and often.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communication and collaboration. It's about actively listening to others, sharing ideas, and respecting different viewpoints. It involves supporting team goals, being reliable in delivering tasks, and helping others when needed. Adaptability, open-mindedness, and a willingness to learn and grow are also crucial qualities for a successful team member in software development.
